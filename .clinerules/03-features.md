**Overall Goal:** Explain how to use the `getSeoMetadata` utility function to manage SEO metadata for pages in the application.

**Content and Structure:**

1.  **Introduction/Overview:**
    * Explain that BuilderKit provides a utility function (`getSeoMetadata`) to simplify generating SEO metadata.
    * Mention its location: `@/utils/seo-metadata` (or `seo-metadata.tsx`).
2.  **Usage (Import):**

5.  **Return Value Explained:**
    * Describe the structure of the object returned by the function, including:
        * `title`, `description`, `keywords`
        * `metadataBase` (app's base URL)
        * `openGraph` object and its properties (`type`, `locale`, `title`, `description`, `url`, `siteName`, `images`)
        * `twitter` object and its properties (`card`, `title`, `description`, `images`)
        * `alternates.canonical` (if `canonicalUrlRelative` was provided)
        * `extraTags` (if provided)
6.  **Integration Example (with `next-seo`):**
    * Provide a React component example (`MyPage`) showing:
        * Importing `getSeoMetadata`.
        * Calling the function.
        * Using the spread operator (`{...seoData}`) to pass the result to the `NextSeo` component (from `next-seo`).
        * Rendering some page content using the SEO data (e.g., `<h1>{seoData.title}</h1>`).
    * **Note:** Explicitly state that `NextSeo` is from the `next-seo` library, which needs separate installation and configuration.

**Formatting and Style:**

    * **Webhook Handling:**
        * Specify the webhook route: `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`.
        * Explain its purpose: processes events (e.g., `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`) to sync subscription data.
    * **Payment Button:**
        * Mention the reusable payment button component (`ButtonPayment`).
        * Explain its role: handles payment flow for different plans and frequencies.
    * **Further Reading:** Refer to "Builderkit Stripe Documentation" for more details.
4.  **Lemon Squeezy Integration Details:**
    * (The provided text only mentions Lemon Squeezy in the overview. If more details exist in the source, they should be structured similarly to Stripe: Configuration, Webhook Handling, Payment Button, Further Reading.)
    * If no further details, the rule should prompt the AI to note this or seek more info if the intent is to document it fully. *For now, based on provided text, only Stripe has details.*
5.  **General Benefits:**
    * Reiterate that these integrations simplify implementing subscription functionality.

**Formatting and Style:**
* Use a prominent warning format for the Supabase prerequisite.
* Clearly list environment variables.
* File paths should be accurate.

**AI Assistant Instructions:**
* Strictly include the Supabase prerequisite warning.
* Ensure environment variable names and file paths are correct.
* If Lemon Squeezy details are sparse in the source, reflect that accurately or indicate it as an area needing more content.
* Correctly reference any external "Builderkit Stripe Documentation."

1.  **Loops Integration:**
    * **Introduction:** Describe Loops as a tool for sending automated emails based on user events.
    * **Capabilities:** Mention triggering emails and updating contact info based on user actions.
    * **Further Reading:** Direct users to "Builderkit Loops Documentation" for configuration and usage details.
2.  **Resend Integration (General Mention, if applicable here beyond Magic Links):**
    * (The provided text under "Emails" immediately goes to "Email Verification using Magic Link" which details Resend. If there's a general Resend setup or usage *outside* of Magic Links, it should be documented here. Otherwise, this section under "Emails" focuses on Loops, and Resend is primarily covered under "Magic Link".)
    * Based on user input, this "Emails" section focused on Loops. Resend's primary documentation will be under Magic Links.

**AI Assistant Instructions:**
* Accurately represent the information provided for Loops.
* Ensure the link to "Builderkit Loops Documentation" is correctly formatted.
* If Resend has general setup distinct from Magic Links and it's in the source material, include it. Otherwise, defer Resend details to the "Magic Link" section.
