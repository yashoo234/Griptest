### Rules for: Email & Google Auth Setup Documentation

**Overall Goal:** Guide users through configuring Supabase for email authentication and optionally setting up Google Auth, including redirect URLs and necessary environment variables.

**Content and Structure:**

1.  **Introduction:**
    * Briefly state the purpose: setting up Email Auth and optionally Google Auth using Supabase.
2.  **Common Prerequisite: Configure Redirect URL (for all Supabase Auth Providers):**
    * Instruct users to go to the "URL Configuration" page in Supabase (provide a link if available in source, e.g., `(opens in a new tab)`).
    * Detail the settings:
        * **Site URL:** The base URL of their application.
        * **Redirect URLs:** `<base-url>/api/auth/callback` (or as specified).
    * Provide an example for local testing: `http://localhost:3000` as the base URL.
3.  **Configure Environment Variable:**
    * Instruct users to add `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to their `.env.local` file.
    * Provide examples: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=<your-base-url>` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`.
4.  **Email Auth Setup Confirmation:**
    * State that core email authentication setup (via Supabase) is now complete.
5.  **Optional: Setup Google Auth:**
    * **Prerequisite:** Clearly state that the above steps (Redirect URL, Env Var) must be completed first.
    * **External Documentation Reference:** Direct users to the official Supabase documentation for detailed steps on configuring OAuth Credentials in Google Cloud Console and enabling Google Auth in Supabase Dashboard (provide the link from the source material).
    * **Brief Overview of External Process:**
        * Set up a project in Google Cloud Console (link if in source).
        * Configure OAuth Credentials for the application via Google Console.
        * Enable the Google Auth Provider in the Supabase Dashboard (link if in source).
    * **Security Note:** Emphasize storing client IDs/secrets securely and never exposing them client-side.
6.  **Email Auth Configuration (Default & Optional):**
    * State that Email auth is enabled by default.
    * **Optional: Turn off Email Confirmation:**
        * Steps:
            1. Go to "Auth Provider" in Supabase (link if in source).
            2. Click on the email option.
            3. Switch off "Confirm email."
            4. Click "Save."

**Formatting and Style:**
* Use bolding for key terms like "Site URL," "Redirect URLs," and environment variable names.
* Clearly list steps for configuration.
* Ensure links open in a new tab as indicated in the source.
* Highlight security notes prominently.

**AI Assistant Instructions:**
* Verify all URLs, paths within Supabase dashboard (e.g., "URL Configuration", "Auth Provider"), and environment variable names.
* Ensure the distinction between mandatory common setup and optional Google Auth/Email Confirmation disabling is clear.
* Accurately represent the external documentation link for Google Auth setup.

        * RLS setup (`alter table users enable row level security;`).
        * RLS policies ("Users can insert their own row.", "Users can update own row.", "Users can read own row.").
        * `handle_new_user` trigger function (to sync with `auth.users`).
        * `on_auth_user_created_trigger`.
    * Note that the script enables RLS by default.
    * Suggest users can verify table creation in Supabase (link if in source).
3.  **Create Subscriptions Table (`subscriptions`):**

6.  **Add RLS Policy for Supabase Storage Bucket:**
    * Go to "Storage Policies" (link if in source).
    * Find the created storage bucket.
    * Click "New policy."

        * Explain `[PROJECT_ID]` placeholder.
    * **Step 4: Get Project ID:**
        * Instruct to go to "General Settings" in Supabase dashboard (link if in source).
        * State that "Reference ID" is the Project ID.

**Formatting and Style:**
