## 📜 Rules for: 📋 NextJS Boilerplate Page

**Overall Goal:** This page must clearly explain the foundational aspects of the NextJS boilerplate, including its general purpose and a detailed breakdown of its file structure. Users should understand where to find key application code, components, configurations, and utilities.

**Content and Structure:**

The "NextJS Boilerplate" documentation page should be organized as follows:

1.  **NextJS Base Boilerplate (Overview):**
    * **Purpose:** Introduce the core boilerplate.
    * **Content:**
        * Explain that it includes essential features and templates for building SaaS applications efficiently.
        * Highlight the availability of pre-built, importable AI modules.
        * Mention its connection to `BuilderKit.ai` if relevant to the overall product suite.

2.  **File Structure:**
    * **Introduction:** State that a standard file structure is followed, specifically the `src` directory pattern.
    * **Root Level (within `src` or project root as applicable):**
        * 🗂️ `src`:
            * Explain it's the root directory for application code.
        * 📄 `config.ts`:
            * Describe its purpose: project-wide configurations (e.g., app name, Stripe base URL).
        * 📄 `.env.example`:
            * Explain its role: lists all required environment variables for the project.
        * 📄 `next-sitemap.config.js`:
            * Describe its purpose: configuration for automatic sitemap generation.
    * **Detailed Folder Explanations (primarily within `src`):**
        * 🗂️ `app`:
            * Describe as the main application folder.
            * List key contents and their purpose:
                * `pages` (if using Pages Router) or route groups/dynamic segments (if using App Router).
                * API routes.
                * `layout.tsx` (for main layout).
                * `providers.tsx` (for context providers).
                * `globals.css` (for global styles and CSS variables, noting it's modifiable).
                * `page.tsx` (example main page for App Router).
        * 🗂️ `components`:
            * Describe as the location for reusable components.
            * Mention the `ui` subfolder specifically for Shadcn components.
        * 🗂️ `types`:
            * `supabase.ts`: Explain it's an autogenerated file containing the table schema from Supabase.
            * `types.ts`: Describe as a place for custom global types.
        * 🗂️ `utils`:
            * `Supabase` subfolder:
                * Explain it contains Supabase client initializations for different contexts: `client`, `server`, `middleware`, and `admin`.
                * Clarify the use case for the `admin` client (admin access for table operations, e.g., in webhooks).
                * **Critical Security Note:** Emphasize that the admin client must *only* be used on the server side.
            * `get-user.ts`: Describe its utility for reading user details on the server side, making it a common function.
            * `seo-metadata.tsx`: Explain it provides modular SEO configuration for easy import and use across pages.
            * `utils.ts`: Describe as containing various helper functions used throughout the project.
    * **Visual File Structure Reference:**
        * The documentation should accurately describe all elements mentioned in the visual file structure diagram provided in the source material (e.g., `src/app/api`, `src/app/folders for pages`, etc.).
        * While the AI might not generate an interactive tree, the text must align perfectly with such a visual if it's intended to be part of the final documentation page.

**Formatting and Style Guidelines for this Page:**

* **File/Folder Names:** Consistently use backticks (e.g., `` `src` ``, `` `config.ts` ``) or another clear emphasis method for all file and folder names.
* **Emojis/Icons:** If folder emojis (🗂️) or file emojis (📄) are used in the source material, replicate them for consistency.
* **Clarity:** Define technical terms or boilerplate-specific concepts clearly.
* **Accuracy:** Ensure all paths and descriptions match the actual boilerplate structure.
* **External Links:** Verify any links (e.g., to `BuilderKit.ai`) are correct.
* **Structure Navigation:** Use headings and subheadings effectively to make the file structure easy to navigate and understand.

**AI Assistant Specific Instructions for "NextJS Boilerplate" Page:**

* When generating content for this page, meticulously follow the structure and details outlined above.
* Pay close attention to the precise descriptions of each file and folder's role.
* Ensure the security note regarding the Supabase admin client is prominently included.
* If the source material implies an interactive file tree, ensure the textual descriptions are comprehensive and match what such a tree would display.
* Cross-reference with the "Getting Started" section if there are dependencies or shared concepts (e.g., `.env.example`).
